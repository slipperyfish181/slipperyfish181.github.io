            <h2>EPS Soccer</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">EPS soccer happens during spring trimester. I think it is important to play
                sports during highschool as
                it
                builds relationship and community. Also, I enjoy playing soccer and it makes me forget about school and
                think about
                soccer, something I love.
            </p>

            <h2>Communtiy</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">EPS soccer has a great community and brings a lot of different people together
                with a common interest. Community is super important to me and soccer is a way where I can connect with
                many different people.

            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Soccer practice takes place at Wiburton park everyday from 3:30 to 5:00. We are
                taken to practice in an EPS bus and can either be taken back to EPS or are parents can pick us up.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Soccer is super fun as it is something I really
                enjoy. I have been playing soccer for almost my whole life and always have fun while playing.</p>
