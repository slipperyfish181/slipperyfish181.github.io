        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">My Genius</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">My genius is soccer. I have been playing soccer for about 8 years and have always
            found enjoyment within the
            sport. When playing soccer I forget about everything and just focus on the game in front of me. I think it
            is super
            important to have a hobby which allows you to forget about everything around you. This is one of the few
            reasons I enjoy
            soccer. Soccer is a sport which can be played and enjoyed by anyone all around the world. For example the
            World Cup
            is a major soccer tournament where countries from around the world come together to celebrate soccer.</p>
